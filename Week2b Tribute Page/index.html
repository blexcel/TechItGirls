            <p>He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft, 
                and was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. In his second season as guard, 
                with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming at 19 
                the youngest All-Star in NBA history. He then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille 
                O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships, and was voted first-team all-NBA 
                from 2002-04. In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. In the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship. Shortly afterward, Bryant was part of the memorial service to honor friend and music superstar Michael Jackson. The following year, the Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.</p>
